## Layout

- `adversary.yaml` declares the adversary manifest.
- `AGENTS.md` gives AI coding agents repository-specific engineering guidance.
- `src/index.ts` contains the TypeScript SDK adversary.
- `dist/index.js` is prebuilt so `adversary run . --repo ...` works immediately.
- `test/index.test.ts` demonstrates testing rules with fixtures.
- `fixtures/clean` should produce no findings.
- `fixtures/vulnerable` should produce one finding.
- `Dockerfile` packages the compiled adversary for the CLI.
